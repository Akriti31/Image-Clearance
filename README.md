<h1>Image Inpainting</h1>
<h3>Goal</h3>
<ul>
<li>To remove small noises, strokes etc in old photographs by a method called inpainting.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Basics</h3>
<p>Most of you will have some old degraded photos at your home with some black spots, some strokes etc on it. Have you ever thought of restoring it back? We can’t simply erase them in a paint tool because it is will simply replace black structures with white structures which is of no use. In these cases, a technique called image inpainting is used. The basic idea is simple: Replace those bad marks with its neighbouring pixels so that it looks like the neigbourhood.
